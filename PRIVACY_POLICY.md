# Privacy Policy for Link Opening Manager Extension

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the Link Opening Manager Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Use
**The Link Opening Manager Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.** Specifically:

1. **Local Storage Only**: All user configurations and settings are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data never leaves your browser.
2. **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics tools or tracking mechanisms.
3. **No Server Communication**: The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not communicate with any external servers.

## Information We Access
The extension requires certain permissions to function properly:

1. **Storage Permission**: Used solely to save your configuration preferences locally on your device.
2. **Tabs Permission**: Used to identify the current website's URL to apply the appropriate link opening rules. We only access the URL, not the content of your tabs.
3. **ActiveTab Permission**: Used to modify link behavior according to your settings when you click on links.
4. **Host Permission**: Required to run content scripts that modify link opening behavior on websites according to your preferences.

## How We Use Your Information
The only information the extension processes is:
- The domain names of websites you visit (to apply your configured rules)
- Your configuration preferences (which websites should open links in current or new tabs)

This information is used exclusively to provide the core functionality of the extension and is never shared with anyone.

## Data Retention
Your settings and preferences are retained in local storage until you either:
- Uninstall the extension
- Clear your browser data
- Manually reset the extension's settings

## Third-Party Services
The Link Opening Manager Extension does not integrate with any third-party services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as we update the extension. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the date at the top of this policy.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please create an issue in our GitHub repository or contact the extension developer.

## Effective Date
This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 21, 2024.
